Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should depict a vibrant and inspiring scene that captures the essence of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and its impact on rural youth like Anjali Singh. 

1. **Central Figure:** Place Anjali Singh prominently in the foreground. She should be depicted as a confident and determined young woman, wearing a blend of traditional Indian clothing with a modern touch. This could be a colorful salwar kameez with contemporary patterns or accessories. Her expression should convey optimism and ambition.

2. **Setting:** The background should depict a rural environment transitioning into a more modern setting. On one side, show elements of a traditional village scene with simple houses and nature, symbolizing Anjali's roots. On the other side, portray elements of a tech-savvy environment, such as a digital classroom or a computer lab, illustrating the transition and opportunities provided by the DDU-GKY program.

3. **Activities and Impact:** Include visual elements that represent the various sectors where skill training is offered. For agriculture, show a young person in a field with modern farming equipment. For construction, depict another individual wearing a hard hat and examining blueprints or building materials. For retail, show a young woman assisting customers in a store. For hospitality, depict an individual in a sleek hotel setting. For healthcare, include a figure in a nurseâ€™s uniform assisting patients. And for information technology, show Anjali at a computer, learning coding or IT skills.

4. **Diversity and Inclusion:** Illustrate a diverse group of young people, including women and members of socially disadvantaged groups, engaging in different activities. This diversity should highlight the inclusivity and empowerment focus of the scheme.

5. **Symbols of Progress:** Incorporate symbols of progress and growth, such as an upward arrow or a light bulb, to emphasize the themes of personal and community development, economic diversification, and poverty alleviation.

6. **Government Support:** Subtly include elements that suggest government support, such as a small emblem or insignia of the Indian government, to indicate the program's backing.

The overall mood of the poster should be hopeful and encouraging, highlighting the transformative power of skill development and the opportunities it opens up for youth in rural areas.
