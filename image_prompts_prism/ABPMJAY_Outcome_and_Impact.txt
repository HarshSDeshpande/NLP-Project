Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should be visually divided into two distinct sections to highlight the before and after scenarios of Anjali Mehra's life, showcasing the transformative impact of the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).

**Before Scenario:**
- The left side of the poster depicts a modest home setting in a small town in India. Inside, Anjali, a 35-year-old woman, is seen working diligently on a manual textile loom. Her expression is one of concentration mixed with strain, reflecting the pressures of being the sole breadwinner.
- Around her, the scene includes her young son playing quietly in a corner with simple toys, and her elderly parents sitting nearby, looking concerned about their health and the family's financial situation.
- The colors are slightly muted to convey a sense of struggle and limited resources.

**After Scenario:**
- The right side of the poster transitions to a brighter, more hopeful setting. Anjali is now depicted with a confident and relieved expression as she stands outside a modern hospital with her family.
- Her son is smiling, holding a small, colorful toy, and her parents appear healthier and more relaxed.
- Anjali is dressed in more vibrant clothing, symbolizing improved living conditions and peace of mind.
- The hospital in the background is bustling with activity, representing accessible and quality healthcare. The atmosphere is lively and colorful, indicating a positive transformation.

**Overall Elements:**
- The poster should have a harmonious blend of colors that transition smoothly from the muted tones of the "before" scenario to the vibrant hues of the "after" scenario.
- Symbolic elements such as a stethoscope, healthcare icons, and the Indian flag may be subtly incorporated to emphasize the theme of healthcare improvement and national progress.
- The overall composition should evoke a sense of hope, empowerment, and gratitude, capturing the essence of how PMJAY has positively impacted Anjaliâ€™s life and many others like her.
