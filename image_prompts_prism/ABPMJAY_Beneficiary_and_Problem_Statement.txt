Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should depict a vibrant and hopeful scene illustrating the impact of the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) scheme on the lives of economically vulnerable individuals in India. 

In the foreground, focus on Anjali Mehra, a 35-year-old female textile worker, shown with a warm smile as she interacts with a doctor at a modern hospital. Anjali is wearing traditional Indian attire, symbolizing her cultural background, and she stands confidently with her young son and elderly parents beside her. Her son, a young boy, looks curious and happy, while her elderly parents appear relieved and content.

In the background, depict a modern hospital building with healthcare professionals actively assisting patients, showcasing a bustling and efficient healthcare environment. The hospital should have clear signage and an inviting atmosphere, conveying accessibility and quality care.

Include diverse groups of people, such as women, children, and elderly individuals, receiving medical services, symbolizing the beneficiaries of the scheme. Some patients are being attended to by nurses, while others are consulting with doctors, highlighting the comprehensive health coverage provided by the scheme.

The overall atmosphere should be positive and uplifting, with bright lighting symbolizing hope and a better future. The setting should reflect an Indian small-town environment, incorporating elements such as local architecture and vibrant cultural motifs to give a sense of place. 

The visual should emphasize the theme of empowerment and relief, portraying how the PMJAY scheme bridges healthcare gaps and reduces financial burdens for marginalized communities in India.
