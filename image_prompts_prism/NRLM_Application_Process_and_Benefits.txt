Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : Create a vibrant and hopeful scene depicting a rural village setting in India, illustrating the impact of the Aajeevika - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM). In the foreground, show Kavita Sharma, a 34-year-old female farmer and Self-Help Group (SHG) facilitator. She stands confidently, surrounded by lush green fields, representing sustainable agriculture promoted by the scheme. Kavita is interacting with a diverse group of women from the community, symbolizing empowerment and collective decision-making.

In the background, depict a small group of women engaged in different activities: one is skillfully crafting handmade goods, another is tending to livestock, and a third is using a tablet or smartphone, indicating digital financial inclusion. Nearby, a community meeting is taking place under a large tree, where members are discussing plans and initiatives, representing the spirit of collaboration and community development.

Include subtle elements indicating financial growth and support, such as a small table with banking documents or a chart showing upward trends. Show young individuals engaged in skill development activities, like learning a trade or working on a small business project, highlighting the mission's focus on employability and entrepreneurship.

The overall atmosphere should be one of positivity, resilience, and empowerment, capturing the essence of the NRLM's impact on poverty alleviation, women's empowerment, and community upliftment. The poster should convey the transformative journey of the community through these collective efforts without using any text.
