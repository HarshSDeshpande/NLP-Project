Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : Create a vibrant and engaging poster for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. At the center of the poster, feature a depiction of Meena Kumari, a 35-year-old woman from a small village in Rajasthan, India. She is actively participating in a community development project, wearing a colorful saree that reflects her cultural heritage. Meena is shown confidently leading a group of workers, both men and women, as they engage in various tasks like constructing a road and building an irrigation canal.

Surrounding Meena, illustrate scenes of rural infrastructure development: a newly constructed road winding through lush green fields, a group of workers digging an irrigation canal, and a serene pond being formed. These elements symbolize the tangible improvements brought by the scheme.

In the background, depict a lively village scene with simple houses, women and men working together, and children playing, symbolizing the enhanced quality of life and community empowerment. Include elements that represent gender equality, such as women and men working side by side, and women taking on leadership roles.

The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with earth tones and vibrant colors reflecting the hopeful and positive impact of the scheme. The poster conveys a sense of unity, progress, and empowerment, emphasizing the benefits of sustainable livelihoods, poverty reduction, and gender equality.
