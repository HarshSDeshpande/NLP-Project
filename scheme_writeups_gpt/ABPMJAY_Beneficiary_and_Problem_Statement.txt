**Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) targets the economically vulnerable segments of Indian society, specifically aiming to cover the bottom 40% of the population, which includes approximately 50 crore individuals. The beneficiaries include marginalized groups such as women, children, and the elderly, who often lack access to essential healthcare services. The problem addressed by the scheme is the limited financial capability of these groups to afford quality medical care, which leads to significant health coverage gaps and high out-of-pocket medical expenses. PMJAY seeks to provide these beneficiaries with financial protection and access to necessary secondary and tertiary healthcare services, thereby empowering them and reducing the healthcare burden.
