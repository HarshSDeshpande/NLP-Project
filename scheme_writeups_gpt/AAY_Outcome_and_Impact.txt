**Outcome and Impact:**

The Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) has significantly contributed to improving food security and nutritional standards among the poorest of the poor in India. By providing highly subsidized food grains, the scheme has helped alleviate hunger and reduce malnutrition, especially in vulnerable groups such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, landless agricultural laborers, and destitute widows. Additionally, AAY has offered economic relief to low-income families by reducing the financial burden of purchasing food, allowing them to allocate resources to other essential needs. Despite challenges such as awareness gaps and instances of corruption, the program remains a pivotal initiative in strengthening food security and enhancing the overall well-being of marginalized communities across the country.
