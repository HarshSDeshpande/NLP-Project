**Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) targets rural households in India, guaranteeing at least 100 days of wage employment annually to enhance livelihood security. The primary beneficiaries include marginalized rural communities, particularly women, who gain empowerment and a sustainable means of income through this scheme. The core problem addressed by MGNREGA is rural poverty and unemployment. By legally ensuring the right to work and focusing on the creation of durable assets, MGNREGA aims to alleviate poverty, bolster rural infrastructure, and contribute to sustainable development. It also addresses the issue of rural-urban migration by providing local employment opportunities.
