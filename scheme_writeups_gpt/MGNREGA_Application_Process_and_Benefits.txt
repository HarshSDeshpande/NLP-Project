**Application Process and Benefits:**

Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), every rural household is entitled to apply for employment, with work mandated to begin within 15 days of application. If employment is not provided within this period, applicants are entitled to receive an unemployment allowance. MGNREGA guarantees at least 100 days of unskilled wage employment annually, offering wages at or above the state-mandated minimum. This scheme empowers marginalized groups by allowing them to earn a sustainable livelihood, contributing to poverty reduction and enhancing livelihood security. Additionally, the works undertaken support rural infrastructure development through the construction of durable assets like roads, ponds, and irrigation canals, promoting sustainable development. MGNREGA also has a significant impact on gender equality by increasing women's workforce participation.
