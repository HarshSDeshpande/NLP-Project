**Outcome and Impact:**

Since its inception, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has had significant positive impacts, including poverty reduction by lifting many households above the poverty line through guaranteed employment. It has also empowered women by significantly increasing their participation in the workforce, thereby promoting gender equality. Additionally, the scheme has led to substantial rural infrastructure development, with many areas benefiting from the construction of roads, irrigation facilities, and other essential community assets. Overall, MGNREGA has been instrumental in transforming rural livelihoods in India, providing a crucial safety net for vulnerable populations.
