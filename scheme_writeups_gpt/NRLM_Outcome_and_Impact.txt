**Outcome and Impact:**

Since its launch in 2011, Aajeevika - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) has significantly impacted rural poverty alleviation in India. The mission has successfully organized over 7 crore households into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) across more than 600 districts, facilitating financial inclusion and access to credit for millions of rural families. It has enhanced income generation by promoting diverse livelihood options in sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts. The mission has also empowered women through their active participation in SHGs, improving their decision-making power and social status. Skill development initiatives under NRLM have enhanced the employability of rural youth, contributing to sustainable livelihood opportunities. Despite challenges in awareness and sustainability, NRLM continues to strive towards creating a more equitable society by empowering the rural poor and enhancing their quality of life.
