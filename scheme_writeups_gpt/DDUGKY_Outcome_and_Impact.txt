**Outcome and Impact:**

The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) has significantly transformed the livelihoods of rural youth in India by providing skill development and ensuring placement in sustainable employment. Since its inception, over 5 million rural youth have received training, with a placement rate exceeding 70%, aligning with the program's goal of securing jobs with regular wages for trained individuals. DDU-GKY has been particularly inclusive, with a notable proportion of beneficiaries being women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and persons with disabilities. By diversifying income sources and reducing agricultural dependency, the program contributes to poverty alleviation and economic empowerment in rural areas. Its implementation through public-private partnerships and adherence to a market-led approach has further reinforced its positive impact, despite challenges in awareness, accessibility, and quality assurance.
