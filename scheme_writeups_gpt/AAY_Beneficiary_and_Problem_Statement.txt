**Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

The Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) targets the poorest of the poor households in India, offering them highly subsidized food grains to ensure food security and alleviate hunger. Beneficiaries are selected from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families with annual incomes not exceeding â‚¹15,000, prioritizing marginalized groups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), landless agricultural laborers, manual scavengers, small and marginal farmers, destitute widows, and physically disabled individuals. Despite the program's crucial role in reducing hunger and nutritional deficiencies among low-income families, challenges such as lack of awareness, corruption, mismanagement, and quality control persist, affecting the program's effectiveness in reaching all eligible households.
