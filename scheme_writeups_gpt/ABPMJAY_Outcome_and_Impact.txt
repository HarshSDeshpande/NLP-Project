**Outcome and Impact:**

The Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) has significantly advanced universal health coverage in India by providing comprehensive health insurance to approximately 50 crore economically vulnerable individuals. The scheme has facilitated millions of hospitalizations through its cashless treatment model at empanelled hospitals, thereby reducing financial barriers to accessing quality healthcare. By focusing on marginalized groups, including women, children, and the elderly, PMJAY has empowered these communities and improved their access to secondary and tertiary healthcare services. Extensive efforts, including awareness campaigns, have further contributed to the scheme's reach and effectiveness, establishing it as a pivotal component of India's public health strategy.
