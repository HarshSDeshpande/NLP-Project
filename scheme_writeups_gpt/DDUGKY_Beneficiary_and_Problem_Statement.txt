**Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) targets rural youth aged 15 to 35 years from economically weaker sections of society, focusing on marginalized groups, including women and socially disadvantaged communities. The program addresses the problem of unemployment and limited income sources among rural households by offering market-relevant skill training and facilitating sustainable wage employment. Despite significant progress in training over 5 million youths and achieving a placement rate exceeding 70%, challenges remain in terms of awareness, accessibility, quality assurance, and effective monitoring.
