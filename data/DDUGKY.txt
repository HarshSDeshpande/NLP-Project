Introduction
The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) is a skill development and placement initiative launched by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government of India, on September 25, 2014. This program aims to enhance the employability of rural youth by providing them with market-relevant skills and facilitating their placement in sustainable wage employment. DDU-GKY is a crucial component of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), which seeks to alleviate poverty through livelihood enhancement.

Objectives
The primary objectives of DDU-GKY include:
- Skill Development: To provide high-quality skill training to rural youth aged 15 to 35 years from poor families.
- Placement Support: To ensure that at least 70% of trained candidates secure jobs that offer regular monthly wages at or above the minimum wage.
- Empowerment: To empower marginalized groups, including women and socially disadvantaged communities, through skill training and employment opportunities.
- Economic Diversification: To diversify income sources for rural households, thereby reducing dependency on agriculture.

Key Features
- Market-Led Approach: DDU-GKY focuses on demand-driven training programs aligned with market needs, ensuring that the skills imparted are relevant to employers.
- Training Duration: The program offers skill training ranging from 576 hours (approximately 3 months) to 2304 hours (approximately 12 months), depending on the complexity of the trade.
- Wide Range of Sectors: Training is provided across various sectors, including agriculture, construction, retail, hospitality, health care, and information technology.
- Post-Placement Support: The program includes support for candidates after placement, helping them adjust to their new roles and providing career progression opportunities.
- Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): DDU-GKY is implemented through partnerships between government agencies and private organizations, enhancing resource mobilization and expertise sharing.

Implementation Structure
DDU-GKY follows a three-tier implementation model:
1. National Level: The DDU-GKY National Unit at MoRD serves as the policy-making and technical support agency.
2. State Level: State Skill Missions are responsible for co-funding and supporting project implementation.
3. Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs): These agencies execute the training and placement projects on the ground.

Funding
Funding for DDU-GKY projects varies based on project duration and whether they are residential or non-residential. The financial support ranges from approximately ₹25,696 to over ₹1 lakh per person. The scheme is fully funded by the central government.
