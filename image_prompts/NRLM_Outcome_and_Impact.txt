Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should be divided into two sections, illustrating the transformative journey of Kavita Sharma and the broader community impact of the Aajeevika - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM).

**Left Side - Before Scenario:**
- Depict Kavita Sharma, a 34-year-old woman from a small village in the Indian countryside, wearing traditional modest attire. She appears determined yet visibly burdened by the challenges of rural life.
- Show her standing in a dry, underdeveloped farmland, with limited agricultural tools and resources.
- Include a small, struggling group of women in the background, symbolizing the initial stages of the Self-Help Group (SHG), engaged in a discussion but with a sense of uncertainty and limited resources.

**Right Side - After Scenario:**
- Present Kavita in vibrant, colorful traditional attire, exuding confidence and leadership.
- Surround her with lush, green farmland, indicating successful sustainable farming practices and better resources.
- Illustrate a thriving community scene, with a larger, more organized group of women actively participating in a well-structured SHG meeting, showcasing empowerment and collaboration.
- Feature activities like women engaged in handicrafts, animal husbandry, and agricultural work, representing diverse livelihood options.
- Include visual elements of financial inclusion, such as a woman interacting with a mobile banking service or holding a passbook, symbolizing access to credit and financial growth.
- Show a group of rural youth engaged in skill development workshops, emphasizing enhanced employability and future opportunities.

Overall, the poster should convey a sense of empowerment, resilience, and positive transformation, highlighting the impact of NRLM in improving the quality of life and social status of rural communities in India.
