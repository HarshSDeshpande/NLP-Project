Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should capture a vibrant and empowering scene set in a small Indian village. In the foreground, feature Kavita Sharma, a strong and determined 34-year-old woman, depicted as a farmer and self-help group facilitator. She is wearing traditional Indian attire, perhaps a colorful saree, and is standing confidently in a lush, green agricultural field, symbolizing her role as a farmer and leader.

Surrounding her, display a diverse group of women from the community, including members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, engaging in a lively discussion. Some are holding farming tools, others are carrying handicrafts, and a few are seated with books and financial documents, representing various activities under the Aajeevika - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM).

In the background, illustrate a community meeting setting under a large tree, where a group of women is gathered, listening to a facilitator explaining the benefits of joining Self-Help Groups (SHGs). Nearby, show symbols of financial inclusion, such as coins, a savings box, and a simple chalkboard with numbers, reflecting financial literacy and empowerment.

In another section, depict a training session where rural youth are being taught new skills, with tools and materials related to agriculture, animal husbandry, or crafts. This symbolizes skill development and entrepreneurial ventures.

Include subtle elements that signify convergence with other government schemes, like small icons of various agricultural and social service activities, blending into the landscape.

The overall tone of the poster should be one of hope, empowerment, and community spirit, highlighting the positive impact of the NRLM scheme on rural livelihoods and the empowerment of women.
