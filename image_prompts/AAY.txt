The Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) targets the poorest of the poor households in India, offering them highly subsidized food grains to ensure food security and alleviate hunger. Beneficiaries are selected from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families with annual incomes not exceeding ₹15,000, prioritizing marginalized groups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), landless agricultural laborers, manual scavengers, small and marginal farmers, destitute widows, and physically disabled individuals. Despite the program's crucial role in reducing hunger and nutritional deficiencies among low-income families, challenges such as lack of awareness, corruption, mismanagement, and quality control persist, affecting the program's effectiveness in reaching all eligible households.

**Application Process:**  
To apply for the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), families must be classified as Below Poverty Line (BPL) with an annual income not exceeding ₹15,000. Priority is given to marginalized groups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), landless agricultural laborers, manual scavengers, small and marginal farmers, destitute widows, and physically disabled individuals. State governments are responsible for identifying beneficiaries through surveys, ensuring that assistance reaches those in dire economic situations. Eligible families are issued special ration cards, distinguishing them as AAY beneficiaries.

AAY offers significant benefits by providing nutritional support and economic relief to the poorest families. Beneficiaries receive essential food grains at highly subsidized rates: wheat at ₹2 per kg, rice at ₹3 per kg, and coarse grains at ₹1 per kg. Each household can receive up to 35 kg of food grains per month, contributing to improved nutrition and reduced financial burdens for low-income families. By ensuring regular access to affordable food supplies, the scheme helps alleviate hunger and malnutrition, particularly among children from impoverished backgrounds.
