Outcome and Impact: **Outcome and Impact:**

The Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) has significantly advanced universal health coverage in India by providing comprehensive health insurance to approximately 50 crore economically vulnerable individuals. The scheme has facilitated millions of hospitalizations through its cashless treatment model at empanelled hospitals, thereby reducing financial barriers to accessing quality healthcare. By focusing on marginalized groups, including women, children, and the elderly, PMJAY has empowered these communities and improved their access to secondary and tertiary healthcare services. Extensive efforts, including awareness campaigns, have further contributed to the scheme's reach and effectiveness, establishing it as a pivotal component of India's public health strategy.
Application Process and Benefits: **Application Process and Benefits:**

Eligible families for the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) can enroll through the Ayushman Card, which provides access to healthcare services, or at Common Service Centres (CSCs) for assistance. The scheme benefits include providing health insurance coverage of up to â‚¹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary hospitalization, covering over 1,400 medical procedures. It ensures cashless treatment at empanelled hospitals, includes comprehensive coverage for all pre-existing conditions, and offers a transport allowance for hospitalization. The scheme is particularly aimed at economically weaker sections identified by the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 and aims to cover approximately 50 crore individuals, enhancing access to quality healthcare for the bottom 40% of India's population.
Beneficiary and Problem Statement: **Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) targets the economically vulnerable segments of Indian society, specifically aiming to cover the bottom 40% of the population, which includes approximately 50 crore individuals. The beneficiaries include marginalized groups such as women, children, and the elderly, who often lack access to essential healthcare services. The problem addressed by the scheme is the limited financial capability of these groups to afford quality medical care, which leads to significant health coverage gaps and high out-of-pocket medical expenses. PMJAY seeks to provide these beneficiaries with financial protection and access to necessary secondary and tertiary healthcare services, thereby empowering them and reducing the healthcare burden.
