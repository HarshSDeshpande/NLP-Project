Beneficiary and Problem Statement: **Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) targets rural households in India, guaranteeing at least 100 days of wage employment annually to enhance livelihood security. The primary beneficiaries include marginalized rural communities, particularly women, who gain empowerment and a sustainable means of income through this scheme. The core problem addressed by MGNREGA is rural poverty and unemployment. By legally ensuring the right to work and focusing on the creation of durable assets, MGNREGA aims to alleviate poverty, bolster rural infrastructure, and contribute to sustainable development. It also addresses the issue of rural-urban migration by providing local employment opportunities.
Application Process and Benefits: **Application Process and Benefits:**

Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), every rural household is entitled to apply for employment, with work mandated to begin within 15 days of application. If employment is not provided within this period, applicants are entitled to receive an unemployment allowance. MGNREGA guarantees at least 100 days of unskilled wage employment annually, offering wages at or above the state-mandated minimum. This scheme empowers marginalized groups by allowing them to earn a sustainable livelihood, contributing to poverty reduction and enhancing livelihood security. Additionally, the works undertaken support rural infrastructure development through the construction of durable assets like roads, ponds, and irrigation canals, promoting sustainable development. MGNREGA also has a significant impact on gender equality by increasing women's workforce participation.
