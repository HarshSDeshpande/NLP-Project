Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should depict a warm and hopeful scene set in a rural Indian village. In the foreground, Asha Devi, a 68-year-old woman with a kind and resilient expression, is shown receiving a bag of rice from a distribution point. She is dressed in traditional Indian attire with a simple sari, reflecting her humble background and cultural roots.

Nearby, a group of villagers, including women and children from diverse backgrounds, are gathered around the distribution point, emphasizing the communal aspect of the welfare program. Some are holding bags of grains, while others are engaged in conversations, with expressions of gratitude and relief on their faces. Asha Devi interacts with them, offering guidance and sharing her wisdom, highlighting her role as a respected elder in the community.

In the background, a rural landscape is visible, with fields and simple homes, illustrating the setting of a typical village. A banner or sign, subtly visible without text, indicates the presence of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme.

The scene should convey a sense of hope and support, with vibrant colors to evoke a feeling of warmth and community spirit. The challenges faced by the program are subtly suggested by a slightly less crowded distribution area, hinting at the issues of access and awareness. Overall, the poster should celebrate the positive impact of the welfare scheme while acknowledging the ongoing challenges in reaching all those in need.
