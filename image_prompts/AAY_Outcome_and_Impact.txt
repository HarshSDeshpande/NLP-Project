Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should vividly illustrate the transformative impact of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme through a before-and-after scenario featuring Asha Devi.

**Before Scenario:**
- Depict Asha Devi as a frail and weary elderly woman, her face showing signs of fatigue and worry.
- Show her in a modest rural setting, perhaps standing in a small, simple kitchen with sparse provisions.
- Include a scene of Asha working hard in the fields, her clothes slightly worn, symbolizing her past as an agricultural worker.
- The environment should convey a sense of struggle, with muted colors and less vibrant surroundings.

**After Scenario:**
- Contrast this with a vibrant, hopeful depiction of Asha Devi after benefiting from the AAY scheme.
- Portray her as healthier, with a gentle smile and a more relaxed posture, symbolizing relief and improved well-being.
- Show her in a brighter, more welcoming kitchen, with a variety of food items such as grains, rice, and vegetables, indicating nutritional security.
- Include a scene of her sharing a meal with her grandchildren, surrounded by a warm, supportive community atmosphere.
- Use lush, lively colors to highlight the positive change and sense of empowerment.

**Overall Composition:**
- The background should transition smoothly from the challenging past to a hopeful present, symbolizing the journey and impact of the welfare scheme.
- Include subtle elements that represent cultural heritage, such as traditional Indian patterns or motifs, to emphasize Asha's role as a cultural guide in her community.
- The poster should evoke a sense of warmth, community support, and resilience, celebrating the scheme's role in enhancing the quality of life for marginalized individuals like Asha Devi.
