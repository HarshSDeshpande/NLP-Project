Beneficiary and Problem Statement: **Beneficiary and Problem Statement:**

Aajeevika - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) primarily targets Below Poverty Line (BPL) households in rural areas, with a special focus on marginalized groups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), women, and persons with disabilities. The program aims to address the problem of poverty by promoting sustainable livelihood opportunities and improving financial inclusion among rural households. NRLM seeks to empower rural poor women through Self-Help Groups (SHGs), enhancing their economic participation, decision-making power, and social status. Despite achievements in organizing households into SHGs and facilitating financial access, the mission faces challenges in raising awareness about its benefits, ensuring the quality and sustainability of its initiatives, and maintaining the long-term viability of SHGs.
