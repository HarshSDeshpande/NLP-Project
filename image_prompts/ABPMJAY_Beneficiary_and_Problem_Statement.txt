Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should depict a heartwarming and hopeful scene centered around Anjali Mehra, a 35-year-old female textile worker, as she experiences the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) scheme. 

1. **Central Focus**: Anjali should be portrayed with a warm smile, standing outside a modern hospital. She is holding her young sonâ€™s hand, with her elderly parents beside her, all looking relieved and content. This symbolizes the peace of mind and support brought by the health scheme.

2. **Background**: Include the facade of a modern hospital in a small Indian town, with visible signage indicating it as part of the PMJAY network. The hospital should appear welcoming and efficient, reflecting accessible and quality healthcare.

3. **Supporting Elements**:
   - Other beneficiaries, such as women, children, and elderly individuals, should be depicted entering or leaving the hospital. They should appear diverse and represent various Indian ethnicities, showcasing inclusivity.
   - Medical staff inside the hospital, visible through windows or doors, should be seen attending to patients with care and professionalism, symbolizing the quality medical services provided.

4. **Symbolic Details**:
   - Visual elements such as the PMJAY logo subtly incorporated into the scene, perhaps on banners or posters at the hospital entrance, to indicate the scheme's presence.
   - Include subtle, uplifting symbols like birds flying or the sun rising in the background, representing hope and a brighter future.

5. **Atmosphere**: The overall atmosphere should be one of optimism and relief, with warm lighting to convey a sense of safety and community support.
