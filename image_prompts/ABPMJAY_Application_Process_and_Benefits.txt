Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster features a vibrant and heartwarming scene set in a small town in India. At the center is Anjali Mehra, a 35-year-old female textile worker. She is depicted standing confidently in front of a modern hospital, holding her young son's hand with her elderly parents beside her, all smiling with relief and gratitude. The background shows the bustling yet modest town, highlighting the contrast between her challenging daily life and the promise of accessible healthcare.

In the foreground, an Ayushman Card is prominently displayed, symbolizing the gateway to healthcare services. Around the card, visual representations of healthcare benefits unfold: a doctor attending to a patient, a nurse assisting in a hospital room, and various medical equipment like stethoscopes and X-ray machines, emphasizing comprehensive coverage.

To the side, a depiction of a Common Service Centre (CSC) is shown, where individuals like Anjali can be seen receiving assistance for the enrollment process. This illustrates the accessibility and support provided by the scheme.

Additionally, a transport vehicle is depicted, symbolizing the transport allowance for hospitalization, ensuring that no beneficiary is left without access to necessary medical facilities.

The poster's atmosphere is hopeful and uplifting, with warm colors and light that convey the transformative impact of the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) on Anjali's life and countless others, showcasing the promise of universal health coverage for the economically weaker sections of India's population.
