Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should feature a vivid and heartwarming scene set in a rural Indian village. In the foreground, Asha Devi, a 68-year-old woman, is portrayed with a gentle and wise demeanor. She has a warm smile, wearing a traditional saree, symbolizing her cultural heritage. Her hands are slightly weathered, reflecting her years of hard work in the fields, yet they are steady as she holds a bag filled with essential grains like rice and wheat.

Surrounding Asha are other community members, including women, children, and elderly, all gathered at a distribution point. The atmosphere is one of camaraderie and relief, as they collect their share of food grains. The distribution point is a simple, yet well-organized setup, with sacks of grains neatly piled and a volunteer assisting beneficiaries.

In the background, the rural setting is depicted with lush green fields, small huts, and a few scattered trees, emphasizing the village's agricultural roots. The sky is clear, suggesting a hopeful and bright future. Asha's grandchildren are playfully interacting nearby, highlighting the impact of the scheme on the younger generation's nutrition and well-being.

The overall composition should convey a sense of community strength and resilience, with Asha Devi as a central figure of encouragement and hope. The poster should visually communicate the positive impact of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme on marginalized communities, focusing on alleviating hunger and providing nutritional support to those in need.
