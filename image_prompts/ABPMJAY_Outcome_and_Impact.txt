Create a poster with minimal text with the image from this image prompt : The poster should vividly illustrate the transformative journey of Anjali Mehra, showcasing the positive outcomes brought about by the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).

**Left Side - Before:**

1. **Setting:** A modest, dimly lit room in a small Indian town, depicting Anjali's life before the health scheme. The room should contain simple furniture and a sewing machine, indicating her occupation as a textile worker.

2. **Anjali's Appearance:** Anjali, a 35-year-old woman, appears weary and stressed. She is dressed in traditional Indian attire, which looks slightly worn out. Her expression reflects concern as she tends to her young son and elderly parents, highlighting the burden of being the sole breadwinner.

3. **Family Scene:** Her young son sits nearby, studying with old books, while her elderly parents rest on a basic cot. The atmosphere conveys a sense of financial struggle and limited access to healthcare.

**Right Side - After:**

1. **Setting:** A brighter and more vibrant environment, symbolizing hope and improvement. The setting is a clean, modern hospital, indicating access to quality healthcare.

2. **Anjali's Appearance:** Anjali now looks relieved and content. She is still in traditional attire, but her posture is more relaxed, and she has a gentle smile, representing newfound optimism and stability.

3. **Family Scene:** Her son appears healthier and happier, holding new books, while her parents look more at ease, receiving care in a hospital setting. A caring doctor or nurse attending to them subtly reinforces the healthcare support they are receiving.

4. **Symbolic Elements:** Include subtle symbols of healthcare, such as a medical cross or stethoscope, to emphasize the theme of health coverage.

The overall composition should highlight the stark contrast between the two scenarios, emphasizing the positive impact of the PMJAY scheme on Anjali and her family's life. The transformation should evoke a sense of hope, relief, and gratitude, portraying the essence of universal health coverage.
